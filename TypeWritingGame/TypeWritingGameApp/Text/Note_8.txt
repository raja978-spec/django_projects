BINARY SEARCH It is used in sorted array to search an particular element Binary search uses divide and conquer method and search space also reduced by half of the array.
This is the efficent search algorithm compares to linear algorithm
EX: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] Here eliminates the half portion of the array(1-4) in each iteration. So 1st iteration search will be in 5-8 2nd iteration search will be in  7-8 (we have four element array that will be reduced half of the array so 7-8)
3rd iteration search will be 8 only (Here we have only two elements so the half of the array is 1 so 8)
