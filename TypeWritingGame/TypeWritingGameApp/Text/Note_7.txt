LINEAR SEARCHING It checks each and evey element in the rest of the array. Returns the element when it is find. EX:
TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY OF LINEAR SEARCH * Here we compare all the element to find particular element that is considered as worst case O(n) and Average case.
* If the given element in first place then it is considered as best case O(1).
* And there is no need to create extra to find element so the space complexity is we just search the element in only one
space where the array elements are stored, so the space
complexity is O(1).
