TIME COMPLEXITY: Helps to analys which DS take less time to perform DS operations.
There are 3 types of time complexity. We perform store,search,add,delete operation 
on N number of data to different data structure.
1. Best case : Big Omega(Omega symbol) Helps to find best data structure apart form two or 
more number of DS to perform store, search,add,delete,modify operation in quick
way and less time.It actually gives time complexity result for 10-100 opeations,
2. Average case: Big Teata(teata symbol) Finds average time of execution process of an data structure.
3. Worst Case: Big O(O) Find worst data structure that take of alot of time to perform DS operations. 
O(N)
* If you don't know the times of execution program it will be represented as O(n)
for i in range(n):print(i)
